Rule

Your task is to find an error in the code.
Whoever finds the first gets a score.

In order to answer, enter your personal number set earlier.
After you have entered the number, enter the correct answer
by entering the line number first and then entering the correct line.
For example, the error looks like this :
4. if(a = b)
Then the correct answer will look like this:
4. if(a == b)
